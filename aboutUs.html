            Lock & Leave Storage and RV is a brand-new self-storage facility that offers both drive-up storage units and open parking spots. Our goal is to offer a self-storage facility where people could access their boats, camping trailers, and personal belongings 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. We know how life goes and you can't always plan to have a boat or trailer pulled out of a facility ahead of time. So, at our facility you can access your stored belongings whenever you want to. We also know you may need something at the last minute outside business hours. With your gate access code, you will be able to get to your stored belongings whenever you need to. Our whole facility is under 24/7 surveillance and no one without a gate access code will be allowed on the property, so rest assured that your belongings are safe and secure.
